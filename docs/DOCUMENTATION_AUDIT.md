# Documentation Audit

## October 8, 2026 — LLM prefix ordering

Moved variable behavior and access-mode prompt sections after fixed runtime guidance. Updated both guides to document reusable prefixes and server-dependent cache behavior.

## March 6, 2026

### Thread action suggestion badges
A new internal LLM-facing thread action suggestion mechanism now exists.

Implications:
- the runtime can emit up to 4 suggested thread actions through an internal UI event
- the renderer shows them as clickable badges above the conversation input
- suggestions are intentionally ephemeral and disappear on click or on any user send
- runtime prompt composition now includes English guidance blocks for thread actions and access-mode limitation handling
- Pi runtime now exposes an internal `get_access_mode` command/tool so the model can re-check the current live conversation mode instead of relying only on the session-start prompt snapshot

### Landing page project
A standalone deployable landing page project now lives in `landing/`.

Implications:
- marketing site deployment is separated from the desktop app renderer
- Vercel can target `landing/` as its root directory
- landing-specific implementation and deployment details are documented in `landing/README.md`

Current limitation:
- download URLs assume stable GitHub release asset filenames and should be updated if release naming changes
